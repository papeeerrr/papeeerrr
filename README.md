**Computer Engineer | Embedded Systems**

## 👋 About Me

I am a Computer Engineering graduate with a strong interest in embedded systems, firmware development, and hardware–software integration. My projects focus on microcontroller-based systems, analog and digital interfacing, and structured embedded programming.

I enjoy working close to the hardware—designing circuits, writing firmware, and debugging real-world embedded systems. I am particularly interested in microcontroller applications involving sensors, control logic, and efficient system behavior.

My goal is to continue developing practical embedded solutions while strengthening my understanding of low-level programming and electronic system design.
